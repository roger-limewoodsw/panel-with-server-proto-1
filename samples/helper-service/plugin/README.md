1. Select all files in this directory and create a zip file. 
2. Rename the newly created zip file to "sample-plugin.avpi"

NOTE: 
On Windows, if the extension is hidden, you need to modify the file options to show the file extension. Alternatively, you can use the command prompt, navigate to this directory, and run this command:
```
rename <name_of_zip_file.zip> sample-plugin.avpi
```
On the Mac, make sure the file extension is shown. 
- Open the Finder
- Go to Finder main menu, click Preferences...
- Go to Advance tab
- Check "Show all filename extensions"
With the filename extension always shown, you can then rename the file to sample-plugin.avpi
